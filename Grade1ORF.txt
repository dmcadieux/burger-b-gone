Bob is a big dog. He is a big lab mix. He plays tag with
the cat. In the hot sun, he digs pits to sit in the mud. If I rub
his hip, his leg jumps up and down.
The dog had bones. He hid his bones in the yard. He hid them
in the pits he dug in the mud.
The dog was always happy. He was never without a bone.
The dog’s teeth were very sharp and white, but he never bit
anyone. He only chewed on bones.
One day the dog was sleeping. A rat came into his yard.
“I will take this dog’s bones,” said the rat. “He is sleeping.
He will never know that I have taken them.”
So the sneaky rat snuck around the yard and stole every
bone. Then he slipped under the fence and climbed up a tree.
He had all the bones with him in a bag.
“I will watch the dog from this branch. I will see what he
does when he opens his eyes.”
The dog opened his eyes. He was hungry. He got up to
dig up a bone. He dug. The hole was empty.
“I am sure that I hid a bone here. I hid it right in the shadow
of this tree.” He looked around.
Then he heard the rat laughing. He looked up and saw the
rat on the branch.
“I took your bones!” the rat yelled.
Just then the bones fell out of the tree. The dog ran under
the fence and got them all. He chased the rat away.

Ann was not a pig in a pen. She was not a hen in a hut.
Ann lived on a farm and had fun with the kids. She had a top
like a mop.
Ann was a big, white sheep. She ran and hid with the kids for
fun. She did tricks for a jelly bean. She liked the red ones best.
“Roll over,” the kids would tell her. “We’ll give you a treat if
you roll over, Ann.”
So Ann would roll over. It wasn’t really that hard. She
would roll over, and the kids would give her a jelly bean.
“Jump over the hay bale, Ann,” the kids would tell her.
So Ann would jump over the hay bale. It really wasn’t that
hard. She would jump over the hay bale, and the kids would
give her a jelly bean.
One day Ann was standing in the field with the other sheep.
The farmer’s kids came out to see her. Ann could see they
were each carrying a bag of jelly beans.
She got really excited. She ran right. She ran left. She did
fancy tricks. She skipped and she hopped.
“Come here, Ann!” the kids called out to her. “Follow us to
the barn.”
They fed Ann jelly beans all the way to the barn. When she
got there, the farmer took her and began to trim her wool.
“Bah!” Ann cried. “Bah! Bah! Baaaaah!”
“Everything’s okay, Ann,” said the farmer. “You just
needed a haircut.” He gave her another jelly bean, and
everything was better.

The cat is fat. He naps in the sun on a mat. The cat lives
with an old woman. He naps in her lap. The woman saw a rat.
“Cat!” she begs. “Hop up and nab the rat!”
The cat will not hop. The cat will not nab. The cat is fat. He
will not get up from his nap.
Harry would close his eyes and purr. He would not get up
to help the old woman. He would not go and catch the rat. Oh
no, he would not move because Harry was very lazy.
One day Harry was sleeping. Something jumped onto his
pillow. Something tugged on his ear. Harry opened his eyes
slowly. A tiny mouse stood in front of him. The mouse crossed
his eyes at Harry. He stuck out his tongue at Harry.
“I bet you can’t catch me,” he shouted at Harry.
“You are right,” Harry said. “I can’t catch you.” Then Harry
went back to sleep.
The mouse watched Harry sleep. “What an odd cat,” he
said to himself. “I have never heard of a cat who will not chase
mice. I think I will call my brothers and sisters. This is a good
place to live. No cat will chase us out.”
The mouse called his family. His family came to stay. They
built nests in the walls. They built nests in the floors. They
built nests in the TV. They even built a nest under Harry.
Harry was asleep, so he didn’t notice.

Tom sat for the bus. He sat in the sun. He sat for the bus
and got hot. Tom sat for the bus, but the bus did not run.
Tom saw a dog. The dog was in the sun. The dog was Spot.
It was Tom’s dog. Spot was hot in the sun. He saw Tom and
ran to him. He was so happy to see Tom that he jumped into
Tom’s arms.
Just then, Tom heard the bus coming. He didn’t have time
to take Spot home. There was no time to think. Tom grabbed
Spot and hid him under his coat.
The bus pulled up to Tom’s bus stop. Tom got on the bus
and went to the back. His friend Jack had saved a seat for him.
Just as Tom sat down, a little yelp came from under his
coat.
“What do you have under there, Tom?” asked Jack.
“If I tell you, do you promise not to tell?” replied Tom.
“You bet. I’m your best friend, aren’t I?” asked Jack.
Tom told Jack what had happened. He asked his friend
what he should do. Jack had an idea.
“You can tell the teacher you have something very cool for
show and tell. Then you could call your mom and have her
come and pick up Spot.”
Tom decided that’s what he would do. His teacher was
surprised. His mom was mad, but Spot was very happy.

Sue was a fan of fun. She liked to play games and have
lots of fun. Sue played games in the house. Sue played games
in the yard. Sue liked old games and new games. Sue and
Josh were pals. They played games in the house. They played
games in the yard.
One day Sue and Josh played a new game. Sue had not
played it before. It was called “Sorry!” She and Josh got out all
of the parts. They tried to read the rules together. Then they
set up the game. They played that game many times.
They had a snack time. They had some cookies and milk.
Then they wanted to play a different game. She picked
“Mouse Trap.” It was fun to set up the parts. They laughed as
they played.
When they got tired of that game, they picked another.
Josh chose checkers. Sue was red. Josh was black. They
were both good at this game. It lasted a long time.
Sue knew Josh’s tricks, and Josh knew her tricks. They
didn’t fall into any traps.
The game lasted so long that no one won before it was time
for Josh to go home.
They left the pieces as they were. They were going to play
again tomorrow. Josh was going to come over after school.
Sue told Josh thanks for coming over. Josh said thanks for
having him over.

Bill, Pete, and Joe liked to run in the big yard. Bill got a bat
and ball. Pete got his mitt. Joe hit the ball and ran. Bill and
Pete ran with Joe. Bill hit the ball, and the ball went far. The
ball hit a kite. The boys ran to the kite to get the ball.
The three friends stood by the kite flyers. They watched
the colorful-coded kites bob and dip and spin in the wind.
At home Bill said to his mom, “I sure wish I had a kite.”
“I can show you how to make one,” she said.
“Oh, boy!” Bill said. “Let me call Pete and Joe. They will
want to make kites, too.”
Mom got all the things they needed. She showed the boys
how to cut shapes from thick paper. They colored-coded the paper
with markers and paint. Bill made a frog kite. Pete drew a
dragon. Joe cut a dinosaur kite. They taped on straws for
support. Strips of newspaper became tails. They tied string to
the kites to hold them.
“Thanks, Mom,” Bill said.
“Let’s fly our kites!” said Pete and Joe.
The boys ran to the playground. They lifted their kites to
the wind. Up, up, up flew the kites. Soon the kites went up and
down and spun in the wind.
“We made good kites,” Bill, Pete, and Joe said.
